Comparative Analysis of Strategies
The drastic difference in performance is not due to a complex trick, but to a fundamental concept in data processing: lazy evaluation (streaming) versus in-memory collection materialization.

SimpleFindStrategy (The Naive Approach)

csharp
var validWords = wordStream
    .Where(...)
    .ToList(); // <--- The problem!
This strategy first filters the wordStream and then calls .ToList(). This method materializes a new list in memory containing every matching word. If the wordStream has millions of words, it creates a gigantic list, consuming enormous amounts of RAM and causing the Garbage Collector to work excessively.

OptimizedFindStrategy

csharp
var frequency = new Dictionary<string, int>(...);
foreach (var word in wordStream)
{
    // ...
    ref int count = ref CollectionsMarshal.GetValueRefOrAddDefault(frequency, word, out bool exists);
    count++;
}
Although its name is "Optimized" and it uses an advanced technique (CollectionsMarshal) to update the dictionary, its flaw is the same: memory usage. It creates a dictionary that stores every unique word found and its count. With a large and varied input stream, this dictionary grows uncontrollably, resulting in the +160 MB consumption we saw in the benchmarks. It optimizes counter updates, but not space - which is the real bottleneck.

SpaceSavingFindStrategy (The Efficient and Idiomatic Approach)

csharp
return wordStream
    .Where(...)
    .GroupBy(...)
    .OrderByDescending(...)
    .Take(10)
    .Select(...);
This is the winning implementation for one key reason: LINQ and lazy evaluation.

No intermediate collections: The chain of LINQ methods (Where, GroupBy, etc.) forms a "pipeline". Data from the wordStream flows through this pipeline lazily.

Streaming Processing: GroupBy processes the stream and groups elements efficiently without needing to load a complete copy of the data into a list first. The LINQ engine is highly optimized to perform these operations with minimal memory overhead.
